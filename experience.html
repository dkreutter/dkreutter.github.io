      <h1 class="title">Research</h1>
      <p>Summer of 2020, I worked as a research assistant in the math department
      at Wesleyan. I spent the first part of the summer studying properties and constructions of k-hypergraphs and later
      began using category theory to describe some of their infinite classes. I closed out the summer by
      demonstrating that closure under a binary operation called free amalgamation is sufficient for a very special property of
      infinite families of hypergraphs to hold.</p></div>

      <h1 class="title"> Farm</h1>
      <p>Summer 2019, I worked as part of a team of 7 on Long Lane Farm, a nonprofit university owned organization dedicated to sustainable agriculture education.
      Besides performing the manual labor intrinsic to farming, I was also in charge of corresponding with our university dining service and
    frequently ran our stand at a weekly farmer's market. During the high point of harvest season, we produced upwards of 100 lbs. of fruits
    and vegetables per week, most of which was donated to local soup kitchen St. Vincent de Paul.</p>
